# Project Description

[DataIsBeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/), the subreddit, is hosting a monthly Data Visualization challenge in 2018.  

On the First Monday of every month of 2018, DataIsBeautiful will schedule AutoModerator to post a unique dataset along with instructions for how to enter. Each dataset will range in difficulty, filesize, and analysis required to make a visual.

Competitions will span four weeks, and will get locked on that Friday. The best visual for each month will be awarded gold, and will be announced in the following thread.

My personal goal will be to improve my visualization abilities utilizing multiple software applications (i.e. R, Python, Tableau, D3, etc...) while learning from fellow competitors.
