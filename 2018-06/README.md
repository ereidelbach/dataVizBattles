# Instructions:

1. Use the dataset below. Work with the data, perform the analysis, and generate a visual. It is entirely your decision the way you wish to present your visual.
2. (Optional) If you desire, you may create a new OC thread. However, no special preference will be given to authors who choose to do this.
3. Make a top-level comment in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/8ogk4k/battle_dataviz_battle_for_the_month_of_june_2018/) with a link directly to your visual (or your thread if you opted for Step 2). If you would like to include notes below your link, please do so. Winners will be announced in the next thread!

# Judging Criteria:

1. <b>Analysis: The analysis is valid.</b>  This means that the data is stratified or transformed correctly, and that the best unit is used for the analysis.
  - "per capita" or an equivalent normalization for populations.
  - "by gender" for stratifying genders where appropriate.
  - "separated by country" where appropriate.
  - "as a percent increase" where appropriate.
  - Transformations are noted where possible.
  - The author clearly notes when and why outliers are excluded
  - R2 values and/or P-values should be available if they're drawing significance as part of the conclusion
  - Units used in the analysis should make sense, or otherwise adhere to convention
  - Bonus points if the source code is available.
2. <b>Display: The visual is technically correct.</b>  This means that the data is presented clearly. It includes factors like:
  - No misleading or mismatched axes or scales
  - Axes are labeled correctly, with units, where needed
  - The chart/post title is plain and correctly describes the visual
  - The chart/post does not draw conclusions or make generalizations based on anecdotes
  - Bar and area charts are not truncated
  - There are no spatial errors within the plot
  - The right type of plot was picked
  - Error bars are present where appropriate
  - No range/resolution issues are present
  - If transformed (e.g. log, semilog), the right transformation was picked and is marked clearly
3. <b>Aesthetic: The plot adheres to good design principles.</b> This means that the image is aesthetically good as defined by the following:
  - The image is colorblind-friendly
  - No chartjunk is present
  - There are no excessive decorations, and the data-ink ratio is efficient.
  - There are no jpeg artifacts
  - No 3D effects were used
  - The visual is high-effort and the author clearly took the time to process a quality visual
  - There is clear front-and-center presentation (the visual is not buried beneath a wall of text)
